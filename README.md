## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

## Notes

It was hard to figure out xcode for the first time. Once difficulty I had was compiling my code and structuring my code in the right way. I restarted the whole project and did it step by step and it worked! I definitely learned a lot more than I expected with this small project.
